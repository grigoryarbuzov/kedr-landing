# Kedr Landing — Vite + React + Tailwind (minimal)

## Quick start

1. Unzip the project.
2. Install deps:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173

Notes:
- Tailwind already configured (tailwindcss + postcss + autoprefixer).
- Images are placeholders SVGs in `src/assets/` — replace them with real photos.
- If you want to build static files: `npm run build` then `npm run preview` to serve the built result.
